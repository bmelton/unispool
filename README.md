# Unispool

A universal cardboard rim adapter. Designed to be filament friendly, truly universal, and to accommodate any rim size you can think of. 

It accepts rim diameter and text as optional parameters.

This relies on a stencil font that is of course easy to install locally, but may not work at all on Makerworld. If you're okay with the centers of your letters falling out, this is still good. If you don't need labels, this is great - just leave the string empty.

# Printing recommendations

Layer height: 0.2 mm or 0.16 mm. given the 1 mm wall thickness, this ensures 5–6 solid layers, which is critical for the structural integrity of the stencil bridges.

Print in PETG or above if you use your AMS heater. PLA might be fine in original AMS units.
